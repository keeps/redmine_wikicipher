== How to change the cipher key

The key used to encrypt is based on the "database_cipher_key" configuration in the +/path/to/redmine/config/configuration.yml+ file.
To modify the key, update the +/path/to/redmine/config/configuration.yml+ file, run the script +/path/to/wikicipherplugin/bin/updatekey.rb+, passing the old key and the new key as parameters and restart redmine.

== How to remove the encryption
